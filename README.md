# E11a-3D
this was a really fun exercise and I feel like I got a lot out of it. I enjoyed working in 3D and found that I was able to make things work more efficiently in a 3D plane. The coding aspects were a lot easier as I was going along with the tutorials, so I had almost no problems this go around.
